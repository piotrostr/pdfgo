# PDF Merger

It is super annoying when you have to pay for merging of your pdf's and the
websites are flooded with ads.

This is a very simple app that just merges pdfs.

```bash
go install github.com/piotrostr/pdfgo
pdfgo serve
```

This will run a server on `:8080` that serves as a dropbox for pdf files

It is also possible to run stuff with the cli
